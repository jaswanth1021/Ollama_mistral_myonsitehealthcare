       " 'response': \" The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. In simple terms, when sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of different colors (wavelengths) that travel as waves. Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet light) are scattered in many directions by the molecules in the air more than longer wavelengths (red, yellow, and green). However, we see the sky as blue instead of violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and because sunlight reaches us more from the blue part of the spectrum rather than the violet. In addition, some of the violet light gets absorbed by the ozone layer in the stratosphere. This is a basic explanation; the actual physics behind it is much more complex!\",\n",
